# My Git Training Repository

### Purpoose of This

I created this repository only to practice and enhance my skills with Git.

Some of the items a I learned with Git was:
1. Using Git Bash
2. git config - command to update both user name and email
3. touch command - create new files
4. git init - command Initialize a Git folder
5. git add - command adds a file to the staging area
6. git rm --<filename> - command removed a file from staging removing
7. git status - command shows the status of all files in the folder
8. git commit - command that opens an editor for user to input comment
9. git commit -m 'comment here' - command that skips the editor; instead you add your comment on the comand line
10. .gitignore - file used to save filenames that Git will ignore when any updates/changes are made to the file that was added to .gitignore. Git "WILL" find updates on .gitignore

These were the main topics I was intereseted in learning on Git. Since I will be working on my personal repositories for the time being, I did not see a need to learn how to Branch and Merge to Master for the time being.
