# My Git Training Repository

### Purpoose of This

I created this repository only to practice and enhance my skills with Git.

Some of the items a I learned with Git were:
1. Using Git Bash
2. git config - command to update both user name and email
3. touch command - create new files
4. git init - command Initialize a Git folder
5. git add - command adds a file to the staging area
6. git rm --**filename** - command removed a file from staging removing
7. git status - command shows the status of all files in the folder
8. git commit - command that opens an editor for user to input comment
9. git commit -m 'comment here' - command that skips the editor; instead you add your comment on the comand line
10. .gitignore - file used to save filenames that Git will ignore when any updates/changes are made to the file that was added to .gitignore. Git "WILL" find updates on .gitignore
11. Create a repository on GitHub
12. git remote - add a remote repository, used command from GitHub
13. git push -u origin master - push project to repository on GitHub
14. git clone - clone a repository from GitHub 
15. git branch - create a branch from the current branch (master) you are on
16. git pull - pulls or updates latest files from GitHub or remote repository
17. git checkout - switch between different branches on local machine (between master and branch)

These were the main topics I was intereseted in learning on Git. Since I will be working on my personal repositories for the time being, I did not see a need to learn how to Branch and Merge to Master for the time being.

Additional commands I learned for Command Line (Windows) or Terminal (MacOS) were:
1. cd - Change directory
2. ls - List files of current directory
3. mkdir - Make directory or folder in the currenty dirrectory you are in
4. touch - create a file
